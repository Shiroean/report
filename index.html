        <h1>Projected Financial Statements</h1>
        <p>Projected financial statements are estimates of future financial performance. These projections are crucial for decision-making, planning, and evaluating potential business outcomes. Businesses create these projections to ensure they are financially prepared for future operations. Let's walk through the key steps to creating projected financial statements using the financial statement method.</p>

        <h2>Definitions and Key Terms</h2>

        <div class="definition">
            <h3>Financial Statement Method</h3>
            <p>The financial statement method is a projection technique used to estimate future financial performance based on historical data and assumptions about future events. It focuses on income statements and balance sheets to forecast sales, costs, profits, and funding requirements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="definition">
            <h3>Projected Sales</h3>
            <p>Projected sales refer to the estimated sales revenue that a company expects to generate in the future. This figure is the foundation of the financial projection process and influences all other projections.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="definition">
            <h3>Cost of Sales</h3>
            <p>Cost of sales (or cost of goods sold, COGS) is the direct cost of producing or acquiring the goods a company sells during a period. It includes materials, labor, and other directly attributable costs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="definition">
            <h3>Operating Expenses</h3>
            <p>Operating expenses are the costs incurred to run the business, excluding the cost of goods sold. These include rent, salaries, utilities, and depreciation. They can be categorized as fixed or variable expenses.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="definition">
            <h3>Net Income</h3>
            <p>Net income, also known as net profit or earnings, is the total profit after all expenses (including taxes and interest) are deducted from revenue. It's a key indicator of a company's financial health.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="definition">
            <h3>External Funds Needed (EFN)</h3>
            <p>External funds needed (EFN) is the additional financing required when a company's projected total assets exceed its projected liabilities and equity. EFN can be raised through debt, equity, or both.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Steps in Creating Projected Financial Statements</h2>

        <div class="step">
            <h3>1. Forecast Sales</h3>
            <p>Sales are the starting point of any financial projection. To forecast sales, businesses typically use historical sales data and adjust based on anticipated market conditions, customer demand, or changes in product offerings.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A company with $1,000,000 in sales last year expects a 10% growth. Therefore, the projected sales for the upcoming year would be $1,100,000.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3>2. Forecast Cost of Sales and Operating Expenses</h3>
            <p>Once sales are forecasted, calculate the cost of sales using a percentage of sales from historical data, adjusted for efficiency improvements. Similarly, forecast operating expenses by separating them into fixed (e.g., rent) and variable (e.g., commissions) costs.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the cost of sales is typically 60% of sales, and projected sales are $1,100,000, the projected cost of sales would be $660,000. If the company improves efficiency, it may reduce the cost of sales to 58%, bringing it down to $638,000.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3>3. Forecast Net Income and Retained Earnings</h3>
            <p>Net income is calculated by subtracting the projected cost of sales, operating expenses, interest, and taxes from projected revenue. The remaining profit is added to retained earnings or equity, depending on the type of business.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If projected revenue is $1,100,000 and total expenses are $900,000 (including taxes and interest), net income would be $200,000.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3>4. Determine Balance Sheet Items that Vary with Sales</h3>
            <p>Balance sheet items such as cash, accounts receivable, and inventories often vary with sales. Use the sales growth rate to adjust these items accordingly.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If accounts receivable are typically 10% of sales, and projected sales are $1,100,000, projected accounts receivable would be $110,000.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3>5. Determine Loan Payment Schedule</h3>
            <p>Analyze the company's current loans and determine the payment schedule for the projection period. Include both principal and interest payments in the projections.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3>6. Compute External Funds Needed (EFN)</h3>
            <p>EFN is the difference between projected total assets and projected liabilities and equity. If the balance sheet does not balance (i.e., total assets do not equal total liabilities + equity), the EFN calculation will reveal how much additional financing the company will need.</p>
            <p><strong>EFN Formula:</strong> EFN = Change in Total Assets - (Change in Total Liabilities + Change in Total Equity)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
            <h3>7. Determine How to Finance EFN</h3>
            <p>If EFN is positive, it indicates the company will need to raise additional funds. Management must decide whether to finance it through debt, equity, or a combination of both. If EFN is negative, the company has excess funds, which can be allocated as desired.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Illustrative Example</h2>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>ABC Corporation - Projected Financial Statements</h3>
            <p>ABC Corporation expects 10% sales growth next year and plans to improve its cost efficiency. The projected financial statements are created using the steps outlined above.</p>
